# UCI-database-patient-model

## Project Description

This project focuses on an analytical approach to predict patient readmission rates using a UCI database dataset. The primary objective is to compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models under various class balancing techniques. Our aim is to determine which model achieves the best balance among precision, recall, and overall accuracy for predicting both readmitted and non-readmitted patient outcomes.

## Models Evaluated

### Logistic Regression

Techniques Used: Different sampling strategies to mitigate class imbalance.
Key Metrics: Precision, Recall, Overall Accuracy.
Observation: Shows a balanced trade-off between precision and recall. Effective when minimizing false negatives is as critical as minimizing false positives.

### Random Forest

Techniques Used: Random under-sampling to address class imbalance.
Key Metrics: Precision, Recall, Overall Accuracy.
Observation: Best used when high recall for readmitted patients is prioritized, even at the cost of reduced overall accuracy.

## Insights

Logistic Regression with Random Under-sampling: Offers a balanced approach between recall and accuracy. This model is preferable when both classes' recall is crucial, albeit with a slight compromise in overall accuracy.

Random Forest with Random Under-sampling: Ideal for scenarios where identifying readmitted patients is paramount. This model prioritizes recall over precision, which may lead to lower overall accuracy but better identification of positive cases.

## Next Steps

Advanced Tuning: Experiment with advanced hyperparameter optimization and mixed sampling strategies (e.g., integrating SMOTE with undersampling) to further refine model performance.

Data Enrichment: Enhancing the dataset, particularly by increasing the number of readmitted patient records, could improve model training and predictive accuracy.

Feature Engineering and Selection: Develop new features or refine the feature selection process to boost model efficacy. Focus on extracting more nuanced insights from existing data or incorporating additional relevant data sources.

## Conclusion

The ongoing analysis has highlighted the nuanced trade-offs between different models and sampling techniques in handling class imbalance. The next steps will focus on leveraging these insights to optimize model configurations for better predictive performance in real-world healthcare settings.
